abstract = "Minimally invasive surgeries (MIS) are gaining popularity as alternatives to conventional open surgeries. In thoracoscopic scoliosis MIS, fluoroscopy is used to guide pedicle screw placement and to visualize the effect of the intervention on the spine curvature. However, cosmetic external appearance is the most important concern for patients, while correction of the spine and achieving coronal and sagittal trunk balance are the top priorities for surgeons. We present the feasibility study of the first intra-operative assistive system for scoliosis surgery composed of a single RGBD camera affixed on a C-arm which allows visualizing in real-time the surgery effects on the patient trunk surface in the transverse plane. We perform three feasibility experiments from simulated data based on scoliotic patients to live acquisition from nonscoliotic mannequin and person, all showing that the proposed system accuracy is comparable to scoliotic surface reconstruction state of art."
